## The important steps to achieve like this project 
1. You should  install visual studio 2019 or above version for c++ compiler because Dlib library is fully developed by c++
2. Dlib:is a modern C++ toolkit containing machine learning algorithms and tools for creating complex software in C++ to solve real world problems.
3. Desktop development with c++ dependncies like in the bottom image (you will find like this image when you want to install visual studio 2019 or above version)

## Need to install all these libraries for python3
1. Pip install cmake
2. Pip install dlib
3. Pip install face-recognition
4. Pip install numpy
5. Pip install opencv-python 

## To run the java frame need JRE(Java Runtime Environement) the extention of the file is .jar
1. You need JDK Java Development Kit to be installed.
2. Download zip file
3. Run file name "Auto Attendence System" jar file. (jdk must be installed)
4. Source code is also uploaded as zip file named "Auto_Attendence_System(source code)".
