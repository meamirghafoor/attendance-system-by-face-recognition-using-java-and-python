## The important steps to achieve like this project 
1. You should  install visual studio 2019 or above version for c++ compiler because Dlib library is fully developed by c++
2. Dlib:is a modern C++ toolkit containing machine learning algorithms and tools for creating complex software in C++ to solve real world problems.
3. Desktop development with c++ dependncies like in the bottom image (you will find like this image when you want to install visual studio 2019 or above version)

## Need to install all these libraries for python3
1. Pip install cmake
2. Pip install dlib
3. Pip install face-recognition
4. Pip install numpy
5. Pip install opencv-python 

## To run the java frame need JRE(Java Runtime Environement) the extention of the file is .jar
1. You need JDK Java Development Kit to be installed.
